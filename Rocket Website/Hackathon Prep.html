      <h1>Let's learn a bit about Mars and Rockets!</h1>
      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          "Other than Mars being right next to us in the solar system, there are
          many other reasons to visit the “Red Planet”. Humans have long
          wondered what happens on Mars; from the sci-fi geeks to the conspiracy
          theorists, they all believe that Mars is an important planet for
          humans to explore. First, humans want to search for life on Mars.
          Recently, many astrobiologists have hypothesized and confirmed that
          Mars once had liquid water flowing throughout, as well as nutrients
          used to supply life and a magnetic field similar to Earth's atmosphere
          which protects life (Anderson, 2017). Additionally, many geologists
          and scientists are bewildered about the planet’s evolution and its
          surface as it could lead scientists to answering the decades old
          question of whether there is any water or life on Mars. Lastly, Mars
          is seen as a very important stepping stone for future exploration of
          other planets and solar systems. Martian rovers like Sojourner,
          Opportunity, Spirit, Curiosity, and Perseverance have all gone to
          collect samples of rock and soil, revealing key details about its
          formation and evolution. A few important instruments on board these
          rovers are MOXIE, to produce oxygen from the Mar’s atmosphere, RIMFAX,
          to analyze the geological structure of the planet’s subsurface, and
          SHERLOC, to detect organic compounds (Instruments-NASA Mars, 2020).
          Reaching Mars requires a rocket, which in turn requires a propulsion
          system for transporting humans and resources from the surface of Earth
          to Mars. A propulsion system can either be an air-breathing or
          non-air-breathing system. An air-breathing system is an engine that
          requires atmospheric oxygen to allow for combustion. A non-air
          breathing system carries its own supply of oxygen. Rockets that leave
          the earth’s atmosphere use a non-air breathing system because in the
          vacuum of space, there is no oxygen. A rocket has four forces acting
          on it during its flight: gravity, thrust, drag, and lift. When
          discussing rocket propulsion systems, gravity, thrust, and drag are
          the most important to analyze in order to create the optimal design
          for the rocket based on its mission."
