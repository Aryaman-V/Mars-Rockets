        Other than Mars being right next to us in the solar system, there are
        many other reasons to visit the “Red Planet”. Humans have long wondered
        what happens on Mars; from the sci-fi geeks to the conspiracy theorists,
        they all believe that Mars is an important planet for humans to explore.
        First, humans want to search for life on Mars. Recently, many
        astrobiologists have hypothesized and confirmed that Mars once had
        liquid water flowing throughout, as well as nutrients used to supply
        life and a magnetic field similar to Earth's atmosphere which protects
        life (Anderson, 2017). Additionally, many geologists and scientists are
        bewildered about the planet’s evolution and its surface as it could lead
        scientists to answering the decades old question of whether there is any
        water or life on Mars. Lastly, Mars is seen as a very important stepping
        stone for future exploration of other planets and solar systems. Martian
        rovers like Sojourner, Opportunity, Spirit, Curiosity, and Perseverance
        have all gone to collect samples of rock and soil, revealing key details
        about its formation and evolution. A few important instruments on board
        these rovers are MOXIE, to produce oxygen from the Mar’s atmosphere,
        RIMFAX, to analyze the geological structure of the planet’s subsurface,
        and SHERLOC, to detect organic compounds (Instruments-NASA Mars, 2020).
        Reaching Mars requires a rocket, which in turn requires a propulsion
        system for transporting humans and resources from the surface of Earth
        to Mars. A propulsion system can either be an air-breathing or
        non-air-breathing system. An air-breathing system is an engine that
        requires atmospheric oxygen to allow for combustion. A non-air breathing
        system carries its own supply of oxygen. Rockets that leave the earth’s
        atmosphere use a non-air breathing system because in the vacuum of
        space, there is no oxygen. A rocket has four forces acting on it during
        its flight: gravity, thrust, drag, and lift. When discussing rocket
        propulsion systems, gravity, thrust, and drag are the most important to
        analyze in order to create the optimal design for the rocket based on
        its mission.
