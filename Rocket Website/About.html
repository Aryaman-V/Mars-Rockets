      Hello, I'm Aryaman! I'm a senior from Naperville, IL. I've had some brief
      interactions with programming from when I took AP Computer Science my
      sophomore year. In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis and hanging out
      with my vex robotics team. When I'm at home, I loving to spend time with
      my family and my dog, Ralphie! I plan to go to college next year to major
      in aerospace engineering. I hope you enjoy my website!
    </p>
