    <h2>Solid Propulsion System</h2>
    <p>
      In a solid propellant propulsion system, propellant is a mixture of fuel
      and oxidizer in solid form. This allows the rocket to be more stable and
      simpler, while it still exhibits consistent performance across ignition
      systems. But this type of propulsion system causes the propellant to burn
      until all the fuel has been exhausted out through the nozzle. Solid rocket
      propulsion systems are considered to be less efficient than hybrid or
      liquid engines (Nancy Hall, 2021). However, solid propulsion systems do
      have their share of advantages. They are known to be compact and are
      smaller in comparison to the traditional liquid rocket. This allows for a
      greater amount of cargo to be part of the rocket. Also, solid propulsion
      systems have a high thrust to weight ratio allowing for a greater
      acceleration than other types of propulsion systems. This Thrust to Weight
      Ratio can be seen through the equation:
      <!--<span>My spaces</span> Tried to use this to create white space between text-->
      Ratio = F/W = Thrust/Weight = (mass*acceleration)/(mass* graviatiational
      acceleration) = acceleration/gravitation acceleration The graviatiational
      acceleration is a constant of 9.8 m/s^2 Since the gravitational
      acceleration is a constant, the larger the acceleration of the rocket, the
      greater the thrust to weight ratio. Additionally, the thrust to weight
      ratio must be greater than 1 for the rocket to accelerate upward. However,
      the solid propulsion system has a relatively low specific impulse in
      comparison to a liquid propulsion system. As solid propulsion systems are
      known to burn their propellant at a predictive rate, it makes it easier
      for scientists to calculate the necessary amount of fuel to reach the
      desired location.

    <h2>Liquid Propulsion System</h2>
    <p>
      The second type of chemical propulsion system is the liquid propulsion
      system. It is known for being the most efficient type of propulsion system
      while also providing a high level of control. Many NASA mission utilized
      this type of propulsion system: Apollo Program, Space Shuttle, and Chandra
      X-ray Observatory (Sands, 2021). The way that a liquid propulsion system
      works is by converting the liquid into a gaseous state which later
      discharges from the engines to create thrust. The liquid propulsion system
      is classified as either a monopropellant system or a bipropellant system.
      A monopropellant system is defined by a mixture of an oxidizer and a
      combustible matter. A monopropellant must go through a catalytic chamber
      in which hot gases are created as a byproduct of the decomposition process
      of the monopropellant. These hot gases then travel through the exhaust
      nozzle creating thrust. A monopropellant engine has a simple design and is
      reliable. However, it achieves low thrust and specific impulse due to many
      issues within the catalyst chamber in the rocket (Nancy Hall, 2021). In a
      bipropellant system, the fuel and oxidizer are two separate liquids. These
      two liquids then travel to the combustion chamber in which the pressure
      increases. This allows for the combustion to shoot out of the exhaust. A
      bipropellant is extremely different compared to the monopropellant. A
      bipropellant engine is more efficient and have a higher exhaust velocity
      in comparison to a solid or hybrid rocket. Alternatively, a bipropellant
      liquid propulsion system is considered to be too complex of a propulsion
      system, meaning multiple failure points and large expenses to design,
      test, and build.

    <h2>Hybrid Propulsion System</h2>
    <p>
      In a hybrid rocket engine, the propellant is a mixture of two forms:
      liquid and solid. In all chemical propulsion systems, a propellant is the
      combination of fuel and oxidizer. In many cases, the oxidizer takes the
      liquid form, and the fuel takes the solid form. An oxidizer is a chemical
      required in propulsion systems to burn the propellant while the most
      common fuel used in rockets are liquid hydrogen, liquid methane, kerosene
      or hydrazine (Braeunig, 2008). The hybrid propulsion system is considered
      to be simple, not too expensive, and safer than rockets with liquid
      propellant (Costa & Vieira, 2010). However, this type of propulsion system
      provides a difficult time for refueling the solid fuel. Furthermore, the
      ratio of the oxidizer and fuel can alter the efficiency of the rocketâ€™s
      propulsion.
