      By the end of this reading, you will brief understanding the three
      different electric propulsion systems: Electrostatic, Electrothermal, and
      Electromagnetic

      The electric propulsion system is a popular technology used on rockets and
      satellites due to its high specific impulse while carrying less propellant
      versus chemical propulsion systems (Choueiri, 2009). However, the main
      disadvantage of an electric propulsion system is that it is unsuitable for
      launches from the Earthâ€™s surface (due to its small thrust). There are
      three main types of electric propulsion systems: electrostatic,
      electrothermal, and electromagnetic. Each type uses a different energy
      source to generate acceleration of the plasma ions (O'Reilly, Herdrich, &
      Kavanagh, 2021). Due to the use of electrical power to accelerate a
      rocket, the distance that an electric propulsion rocket travels is much
      further than chemical propulsion systems with the same amount of
      propellant. The reason behind this is due to its unique way of creating
      thrust which is different to chemical propulsion systems. Certain
      propulsion systems emit heavy gases such as xenon to create thrust. A
      propulsion system that companies such as NASA and SpaceX are thinking
      about using is an ion propulsion system. Ion thruster, an electric
      propulsion system, is currently being used by NASA to keep geosynchronous
      Earth orbit communication satellites in their desired locations. For
      example, the Dawn spacecraft, which used an ion propulsion system,
      continued to accelerate for 11 years before running out of fuel (Wall,
      2018).
