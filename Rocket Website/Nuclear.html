      The nuclear propulsion system for spacecrafts is a theory that was created
      half a century ago. But rockets with a nuclear propulsion system have
      never been developed due to the high risk of spreading radioactive debris
      in the event of an accident. Nuclear rocket engines either use a solid
      core system or a fluid core system. The solid core system is very similar
      to the traditional liquid propulsion system; the only part that has
      changed is that the combustion chamber 4 has been replaced by a reactor
      (Poston, 2021). The nuclear electric propulsion generates electricity
      through a nuclear reactor and transfer it to electric thrusters to create
      an exhaust velocity (Bennet, 2021). A nuclear thermal propulsion system is
      considered to have a high exhaust velocity and a high specific impulse
      (Dunbar, Nuclear Propulsion Could Help Get Humans to Mars Faster, 2021).
      The reason scientists and engineers investigated the possibility of a
      nuclear propulsion system is due to its high thrust and high specific
      impulse. This would allow for an increase in interplanetary trips while
      decreasing the duration of each trip.
